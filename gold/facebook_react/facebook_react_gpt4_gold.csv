Adds experimental flag to yield many times per frame using a message
event loop, instead of the current approach of guessing the next vsync
and yielding at the end of the frame.

This new approach forgoes a `requestAnimationFrame` entirely. It posts a
message event and performs a small amount of work (5ms) before yielding
to the browser, regardless of where it might be in the vsync cycle. At
the end of the event, if there's work left over, it posts another
message event.

This should keep the main thread responsive even for really high frame
rates. It also shouldn't matter if the hardware frame rate changes after
page load (our current heuristic only detects if the frame rate
increases, not decreases).

~~[Fizz] Duplicate completeBoundaryWithStyles to not reference globals~~

## Summary

Follow-up / cleanup PR to #25437

- `completeBoundaryWithStylesInlineLocals` is used by the Fizz external
runtime, which bundles together all Fizz instruction functions (and is
able to reference / rename `completeBoundary` and `resourceMap` as
locals).
- `completeBoundaryWithStylesInlineGlobals` is used by the Fizz inline
script writer, which sends Fizz instruction functions on an as-needed
basis. This version needs to reference `completeBoundary($RC)` and
`resourceMap($RM)` as globals.

Ideally, Closure would take care of inlining a shared implementation,
but I couldn't figure out a zero-overhead inline due to lack of an
`@inline` compiler directive. It seems that Closure thinks that a shared
`completeBoundaryWithStyles` is too large and will always keep it as a
separate function. I've also tried currying / writing a higher order
function (`getCompleteBoundaryWithStyles`) with no luck



## How did you test this change?
- generated Fizz inline instructions should be unchanged
- bundle size for unstable_external_runtime should be slightly smaller

## Summary

We see recent bug reports like #25755 and #25769 for devtools. Whenever
a component uses hook `useEffect`, it triggers an error.
This was introduced in #25663 when we try to keep the `ReactFiberFlags`
numbers consistent with reconciler, in order to fix an issue with server
components.
However, the values of `ReactFiberFlags` in reconciler were actually
changed a while ago in
https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/b4204ede66284e7153ffb11fd434cd9b9a64a56f
We made this mistake because, although it's not mentioned in the
comment, `DidCapture` and `Hydrating` are actually used by DevTools

This caused
- the latest (not stable) react version is broken on devtools before
4.27.0 (but only in uncommon cases such server components)
- all earlier react versions are broken on latest devtools (4.27.0)

To keep most versions work, we need to revert the commit that changed
the `ReactFiberFlags` values

Add a lint rule that fails if an invariant message is not part of the
error code map.

The goal is to be more disciplined about adding and modifiying
production error codes. Error codes should be consistent across releases
even if their wording changes, for continuity in logs.

Currently, error codes are added to the error code map via an automated
script that runs right before release. The problem with this approach is
that if someone modifies an error message in the source, but neglects to
modify the corresponding message in the error code map, then the message
will be assigned a new error code, instead of reusing the existing one.

Because the error extraction script only runs before a release, people
rarely modify the error code map in practice. By moving the extraction
step to the PR stage, it forces the author to consider whether the
message should be assigned a new error code. It also allows the reviewer
to review the changes.

The trade off is that it requires more effort and context to land new
error messages, or to modify existing ones, particular for new
contributors who are not familiar with our processes.

Since we already expect users to lint their code, I would argue the
additional burden is marginal. Even if they forget to run the lint
command locally, they will get quick feedback from the CI lint job,
which typically finishes within 2-3 minutes.

Because `postTask` returns a promise, errors inside a `postTask`

in the console, because the fact that `postTask` is a promise-based API
is an implementation detail from the perspective of the developer.
""Promise rejection"" is a red herring.

The old (unstable) mechanism for suspending was to throw a promise. The
purpose of throwing is to interrupt the component's execution, and also
to signal to React that the interruption was caused by Suspense as
opposed to some other error.

A flaw is that throwing is meant to be an implementation detail — if
code in userspace catches the promise, it can lead to unexpected
behavior.

With `use`, userspace code does not throw promises directly, but `use`
itself still needs to throw something to interrupt the component and
unwind the stack.

The solution is to throw an internal error. In development, we can
detect whether the error was caught by a userspace try/catch block and
log a warning — though it's not foolproof, since a clever user could
catch the object and rethrow it later.

The error message includes advice to move `use` outside of the try/catch
block.

We currently throw an error when disableJavaScriptURLs is on and trigger

those environments what happens is that the error is triggered when you

something it'll never show up and since the error just logs to the

We can simulate the same without CSP by simply generating a different
`javascript:` url that throws instead of executing the potential attack
vector.

preventDefault before using them in practice. This might be legit for
forms. We still don't recommend using them for links-as-buttons since
it'll be possible to ""Open in a New Tab"" and other weird artifacts. For
links we still recommend the technique of assigning a button role etc.

### Based on #27453

If optimistic state is updated, and there's no startTransition on the
stack, there are two likely scenarios.

One possibility is that the optimistic update is triggered by a regular
event handler (e.g. `onSubmit`) instead of an action. This is a mistake
and we will warn.

The other possibility is the optimistic update is inside an async
action, but after an `await`. In this case, we can make it ""just work""
by associating the optimistic update with the pending async action.

Technically it's possible that the optimistic update is unrelated to the
pending action, but we don't have a way of knowing this for sure because
browsers currently do not provide a way to track async scope. (The
AsyncContext proposal, if it lands, will solve this in the future.)
However, this is no different than the problem of unrelated transitions
being grouped together — it's not wrong per se, but it's not ideal.

Fixes a bug where lower priority updates on a components wrapped with
`memo` are sometimes left dangling in the queue without ever being
processed, if they are preceded by a higher priority bailout.

Cause
-----

The pending update priority field is cleared at the beginning of
`beginWork`. If there is remaining work at a lower priority level, it's
expected that it will be accumulated on the work-in-progress fiber
during the begin phase.

There's an exception where this assumption doesn't hold:
SimpleMemoComponent contains a bailout that occurs *before* the
component is evaluated and the update queues are processed, which means
we don't accumulate the next priority level. When we complete the fiber,
the work loop is left to believe that there's no remaining work.

Mitigation
----------

Since this only happens in a single case, a late bailout in
SimpleMemoComponent, I've mitigated the bug in that code path by
restoring the original update priority from the current fiber.

This same case does not apply to MemoComponent, because MemoComponent
fibers do not contain hooks or update queues; rather, they wrap around
an inner fiber that may contain those. However, I've added a test case
for MemoComponent to protect against a possible future regression.

Possible next steps
-------------------

We should consider moving the update priority assignment in `beginWork`
out of the common path and into each branch, to avoid similar bugs in
the future.
","['packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberBeginWork.js', 'packages/react-reconciler/src/__tests__/ReactMemo-test.internal.js']","Lower priority updates on components wrapped with `memo` may sometimes be left hanging in the queue without being processed, if these updates are preceded by a higher priority bailout.

However, in the case of SimpleMemoComponent, an early bailout can occur before the component is evaluated and update queues processed – leading the work loop to mistakenly believe there is no remaining work. This scenario is not applicable to MemoComponent as these fibers do not contain hooks or update queues, instead wrapping around another fiber that may contain such."

`chrome.devtools.inspectedWindow.eval` is asynchronous, so using it in
`setInterval` is a mistake.
Sometimes this results into mounting React DevTools twice, and user sees
errors about duplicated fibers in store.

With these changes, `executeIfReactHasLoaded` executed recursively with
a threshold (in case if page doesn't have react).

Although we minimize the risk of mounting DevTools twice here, this
approach is not the best way to have this problem solved. Dumping some
thoughts and ideas that I've tried, but which are out of the scope for
this release, because they can be too risky and time-consuming.
Potential changes:
- Have 2 content scripts:
  - One `prepareInjection` to notify service worker on renderer attached
- One which runs on `document_idle` to finalize check, in case if there
is no react
- Service worker will notify devtools page that it is ready to mount
React DevTools panels or should show that there is no React to be found
- Extension port from devtools page should be persistent and connected
when `main.js` is executed
- Might require refactoring the logic of how we connect devtools and
proxy ports


Some corner cases:
- Navigating to restricted pages, like `chrome://<something>` and back
- When react is lazily loaded, like in an attached iframe, or just
opened modal
- In-tab navigation with pre-cached pages, I think only Chrome does it
- Firefox is still on manifest v2 and it doesn't allow running content
scripts in ExecutionWorld.MAIN, so it requires a different approach

This is a partial replacement for the 'Press' responder:

1. `useTap` is scoped to pointers (no keyboard support). Our current thinking is
that ""responders"" should be limited to working with pointers, and that they can
be combined with 'useKeyboard' in user-space. For example, we might create a
'usePress' hook in user-space that combines 'useTap' with 'useKeyboard' to react
to both pointers and keyboard interactions.

2. `useTap` cancels the gesture once the pointer moves over an element that is
not within the responder target's subtree. This differs from `usePress` (and
React Native), where the gesture remains active after the pointer exits the
target's subtree and is restarted once the pointer reenters. One of the
drawbacks with the `usePress` behavior is that it requires repeatedly measuring
DOM elements (which can cause jank) to perform hit region tests. `useTap` avoids
doing this and relies on `document.elementFromPoint` only to support the
TouchEvent fallbacks.

3. `useTap` calls `onTapUpdate` when the active gesture's state changes,
`onTapEnd` when the gesture successfully completes. and `onTapCancel` when it
fails. There is no `onTap` callback. `usePress` did not explicitly report back
when the gesture failed, and product developers were confused about the
difference between `onPress` and `onPressEnd`.

4. `useTap` explicitly separates the PointerEvent implementation from the
MouseEvent/TouchEvent fallback.

5. `useTap` has better unit test coverage . All pointer types and the fallback
environment are tested. The shape of the gesture state object is also defined
and tested.

## Summary

CSS has a new property called `scale` (`scale: 2` is a shorthand for
`transform: scale(2)`).

In vanilla JavaScript, we can do the following:

```js
document.querySelector('div').scale = 2;
```

which will make the `<div>` twice as big. So in JavaScript, it is
possible to pass a plain number.
However, in React, the following does not work currently:


```js
<div style={{scale: 2}}>
```

because `scale` is not in the list of unitless properties. This PR adds
`scale` to the list.

* Implements useId hook for Flight server.

The approach for ids for Flight is different from Fizz/Client where there is a need for determinancy. Flight rendered elements will not be rendered on the client and as such the ids generated in a request only need to be unique. However since FLight does support refetching subtrees it is possible a client will need to patch up a part of the tree rather than replacing the entire thing so it is not safe to use a simple incrementing counter. To solve for this we allow the caller to specify a prefix. On an initial fetch it is likely this will be empty but on refetches or subtrees we expect to have a client `useId` provide the prefix since it will guaranteed be unique for that subtree and thus for the entire tree. It is also possible that we will automatically provide prefixes based on a client/Fizz useId on refetches

in addition to the core change I also modified the structure of options for renderToReadableStream where `onError`, `context`, and the new `identifierPrefix` are properties of an Options object argument to avoid the clumsiness of a growing list of optional function arguments.

2. visit http://localhost:3000/loading
3. click ""electronics"" button to navigate to
http://localhost:3000/loading/electronics to trigger hydrating
4. inspect one of the skeleton card UI from React DevTools extension

### The root cause & fix
This bug was introduced in #22527. When syncing reconciler changes, the
value of `Hydrating` was copied from another variable `Visibility` (one
more zero in the binary number).
To avoid this kind of issue in the future, a new file `ReactFiberFlags`
is created following the same format of the one in reconciler, so that
it's easier to sync the number without making mistakes.
The reconciler fiber flag file is also updated to reflect which of the
flags are used in devtools

## How did you test this change?

When an update flows into a dehydrated boundary, React cannot apply the
update until the boundary has finished hydrating. The way this currently
works is by scheduling a slightly higher priority task on the boundary,
using a special lane that's reserved only for this purpose. Because the
task is slightly higher priority, on the next turn of the work loop, the
Scheduler will force the work loop to yield (i.e. shouldYield starts
returning `true` because there's a higher priority task).

The downside of this approach is that it only works when time slicing is
enabled. It doesn't work for synchronous updates, because the
synchronous work loop does not consult the Scheduler on each iteration.

We plan to add support for selective hydration during synchronous
updates, too, so we need to model this some other way.

I've added a special internal exception that can be thrown to force the
work loop to interrupt the work-in-progress tree. Because it's thrown
from a React-only execution stack, throwing isn't strictly necessary —
we could instead modify some internal work loop state. But using an
exception means we don't need to check for this case on every iteration
of the work loop. So doing it this way moves the check out of the fast
path.

The ideal implementation wouldn't need to unwind the stack at all — we
should be able to hydrate the subtree and then apply the update all
within a single render phase. This is how we intend to implement it in
the future, but this requires a refactor to how we handle ""stack""
variables, which are currently pushed to a per-render array. We need to
make this stack resumable, like how context works in Flight and Fizz.
